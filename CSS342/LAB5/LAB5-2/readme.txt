State of Program:
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Our program works with the test data.
We have no memory leaks but 4 errors with valgrind.
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.
-We are proud that we have a working program that does what the test data is 
suppose to be able to do.
-We also got inheritance to work with our program.
-We used a pointer to a pointer that points to an object
-Initially valgrind had a few memory leaks after we integrated all the objects
The source was the destruction of the BSTree
-We created the withdrawal method return an int so it can be directly
called in the deposit method
